		<h1>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</h1>
<p>Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</p>
<p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Your eyes can deceive you. <strong> Don't trust them.</strong> <em> Your eyes can deceive you.</em> Don't trust them.</p>
<h2>Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.</h2>
<p>I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</p>
<p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? What?! I'm trying not to, kid. I'm trying not to, kid.</p>
<h3>You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!</h3>
<p>Don't underestimate the Force. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</p>
<p>I find your lack of faith disturbing. What!? I find your lack of faith disturbing. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
<p>Ye-ha! Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!</p>
<p>Ye-ha! I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? I call it luck. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
<p>Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. As you wish. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.</p>
<p>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.</p>
<p>Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. As you wish. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.</p>
<p>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Don't underestimate the Force. What!? In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly…</p>
<p>You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Red Five standing by. I find your lack of faith disturbing. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</p>
<p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I call it luck. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.</p>
<p>You mean it controls your actions? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
<p>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</p>
<p>But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</p>
