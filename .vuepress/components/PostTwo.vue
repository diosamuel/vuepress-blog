		<h1>Watching ice melt. This is fun.</h1>
<p>I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. I'm really more an apartment person. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. Like a sloth. I can do that.</p>
<p>I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. I'm generally confused most of the time. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. <strong> Hello, Dexter Morgan.</strong> <em> I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece.</em> And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.</p>
<h2>I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister.</h2>
<p>Like a sloth. I can do that. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. He taught me a code. To survive. You all right, Dexter?</p>
<p>I have a dark side, too. You look…perfect. Hello, Dexter Morgan. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I'm really more an apartment person. Keep your mind limber.</p>
<h3>I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.</h3>
<p>Only you could make those words cute. Cops, another community I'm not part of. I am not a killer. God created pudding, and then he rested.</p>
<p>I like seafood. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized.</p>
<p>I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.</p>

<p>I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? God created pudding, and then he rested. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. God created pudding, and then he rested.</p>
<p>I am not a killer. Cops, another community I'm not part of. I'm really more an apartment person. You all right, Dexter?</p>
<p>This man is a knight in shining armor. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I'm really more an apartment person.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. Tell him time is of the essence. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I like seafood. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.</p>
<p>I am not a killer. Hello, Dexter Morgan. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. Cops, another community I'm not part of.</p>
<p>I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. You all right, Dexter? I'm really more an apartment person. Cops, another community I'm not part of. I am not a killer.</p>

<p>You look…perfect. This man is a knight in shining armor. Makes me a … scientist. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.</p>
<p>You look…perfect. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. This man is a knight in shining armor. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized.</p>
